;; Duration: ~30 days (4,320 blocks)

;; Milestones:
;; 1. Complete HTML/CSS project
;; 2. Build JavaScript app
;; 3. Create full-stack project
;; 4. Deploy to production

;; If group completes 3/4 milestones (75% < 80%):
;; - Stakes forfeited to platform pool

;; If group completes 4/4 milestones (100% >= 80%):
;; - Each member gets: 10 STX + 1 STX bonus = 11 STX
